#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will identifythe relation between Intensity of plane polarized light and the intensity of light coming out of analyzer. | Student will complete introduction. He will be given 4 images for the graph between Intensity of light coming out of analyzer and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ and will choose correct image from them. | Choose the correct image for the graph between Intensity of light coming out of analyzer and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ.<br><img src="images/polar1.png"><br>A.  Image1 <br> B. Image2 <br> C. Image3 <br> <b> D. Image4 </b> <br>
2.| To enable the student to describe the methodology to vary the angle between polarizer and analyzer and to observe the variation in the intensity of light coming out of analyzer. | Student will be given 4 images for the correct procedure to be followed in the experiment. He will choose correct image from them. | Choose the correct image for the graph between Intensity of light coming out of analyzer and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ.<br><img src="images/polar2.png"><br> A.  Image1 <br> B. Image2 <br> C. Image3 <br> <b> D. Image4 </b> <br>
3.| Student will be able to Predict the variation of intensity of the light coming out of Analyzer  by plotting a graph between Cos<sup>2</sup>θand Power in the detector (Intensity of the falling light) | Student will make experimental setup followed by setting angle between polarizer and analyzer and will read the power of detector due to intensity of light coming from analyzer. | Property of Polarization can be observed in: <br> a) Transverse wave <br> b) longitudinal wave <br>  c) both <br> d) NOT <br> 
4.| Student will examinethe nature of plotted graph. | Student will take observations for intensity of light coming from analyzer and plot graph between Intensity and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ. | Nature of graph between intensity light coming out of Analyzer and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ is : <br> a) Straight line <br> b) Parabolic  <br> c) hyperbolic	 <br> <b>  d) Circular </b> <br>  
5.| Conclude the linearity of the plotted graph and hence observe the law of Polarization (Malus law) | Students will observe the nature of the  graph between intensity and Cos2θ and will conclude about law of Polarization (Malus law) | Almost no light will come out of analyzer if the angle between polarizer and analyzer is : <br> a) 0<sup>0</sup> <br>b) 180<sup>0</sup>	 <br>c) 90<sup>0</sup> <br> d) NOT </b> <br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Simulator will allow student to make experimental setup and will alert him in case of setup made.| Student will slide the power button of the simulator to ON position  | To initiate the simulator
2.| Simulator will show the green light indicating that the simulator is ready for use.  | Student will choose the desired angle between polarizer and analyzer.  |  To find the Intensity of the light coming out of Analyzer corresponding to each angle between polarizer and analyzer.
3.| Simulator will show the corresponding power in the detector. | Student will mention these power and angle values in the table. | To get the I and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ values with respect to the changing angle between polarizer and analyzer.
4.| Simulator will calculate I and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ values corresponding to each θ value entered in the Table. | Student will press the draw Graph button  |  To plot graph between I and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ
5.| Simulator will show plot between I and Cos<sup>2</sup>θ | Student will observe the nature of the graph.  |  To verify law of Polarization (Malus law)
