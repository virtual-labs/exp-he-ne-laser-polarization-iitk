The intensity of plane polarized light will be maximum when the polarization axis of the analyzer coincides with that of the polarizer and minimum when the two axes are crossed. For any other position of the axis of the analyzer Î¸ with respect to the axis of the polarizer, the output intensity (I) will follow the following relation:<br><br>
I=I<sub>m</sub>cos<sup>2</sup>&theta;<br><br>
Where the maximum intensity I<sub>m</sub> corresponds to the case where the abovementioned two axes matched.<br>
